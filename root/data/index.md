## Features

Some of the high-level capabilities and objectives of Data pipelines include:

1. Support a variety of input formats (Darwin Core, ABCD, CSV files, Excel files, Shapefiles etc) with easy opportunity to include new connectors
2. Support batch (e.g. a project CSV) and streaming inout (e.g. append-only tracking data)
3. Align data to a standardized vocabularies, supporting multilingual data labelling
4. Apply quality controls to flag errors, detect outliers and apply statements about the suitability of the data for a variety of uses (also known as fitness for use indicators)
